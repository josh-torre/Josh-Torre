PROJECTS
Automated Soft Collections Report – SPIROL International Corporation
•	I developed an end-to-end process to automate a report which automatically creates soft collections messages for SPIROL’s 15,000 global customers. Over the summer, I worked closely with users at all levels in the business to perfect the process and continue to iterate on its success.
•	An estimated cost savings of $100,000 over three years. This new feature led to faster response times by customers and improved their overall user experience though a pre-generated response field and modern interface.
A* Algorithm Visualization – AP Computer Science Principles
•	Using Java and the Applet viewer, I developed a visualization which steps through the individual choices the A* algorithm makes when finding the shortest path between two points.  The visualization creates a randomized grid of obstacles and starting and end points at opposite corners of the window. The user can manipulate the percentage of obstacles and the size of the grid area where the size of the grid would change dynamically with the size of the window.
